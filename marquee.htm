    April is the cruellest month, breeding
   Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
   Memory and desire, stirring
   Dull roots with spring rain.
   Winter kept us warm, covering
   Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
   A little life with dried tubers.
   Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
   With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
   And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
   And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
